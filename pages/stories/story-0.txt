ðŸ˜‚ see mine is creepy. It was about 2 am driving home from my dads (he never shuts up so I can never leave at a decent time ðŸ™„) so I was a little drowsy while driving. I take my exit and itâ€™s this big curve ramp going onto another highway and as Iâ€™m about to merge I see this pale naked body on the side of the road. It looked... not human. I couldnâ€™t make out what it was cause it was dark and I wasnâ€™t gonna slam on my breaks. I still donâ€™t know if I saw a dead body of a human or.. something else. - Lynlea
