Alright so you familiar with getting pulled over? I have been pulled over a lot...often times in dark back roads police officers will put a spot light on your vehicle so they can see whats going on. 

I was driving home to into Jackson County and the entire back of my vehicle lit up just like when I had been pulled over...so I assumed a cop was behind me..except no flashing lights so I slowed down waiting for the blues to hit and looking for a place to pull over...never happened though...the light went passed my truck and blurred ahead of me above the trees fast as hell. 

Never heard a sound. Not a helicopter, plane, engine anything...just spot lighted then it took off into the sky. - extraterrestrial_mind_
