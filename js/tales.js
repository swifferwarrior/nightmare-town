I take my exit and itâ€™s this big curve ramp going onto another highway and as Iâ€™m about to merge I see this pale naked body on the side of the road. It looked... not human. I couldnâ€™t make out what it was cause it was dark and I wasnâ€™t gonna slam on my breaks. I still donâ€™t know if I saw a dead body of a human or.. something else. <br><br>- Lynnlea';
stories[1] = 'Alright so you familiar with getting pulled over? I have been pulled over a lot...often times in dark back roads police officers will put a spot light on your vehicle so they can see whats going on. <br><br>I was driving home to into Jackson County and the entire back of my vehicle lit up just like when I had been pulled over...so I assumed a cop was behind me..except no flashing lights so I slowed down waiting for the blues to hit and looking for a place to pull over...never happened though...the light went passed my truck and blurred ahead of me above the trees fast as hell. <br><br>Never heard a sound. Not a helicopter, plane, engine anything...just spot lighted then it took off into the sky.<br><br>- extraterrestrial_mind_';
