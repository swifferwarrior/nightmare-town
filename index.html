            <p>Hi there! We are your hosts, Betty Boom and Mandamonium. We would like to welcome you to NightmareTown, 
                a whimsically creepy podcast where each episode we read stories based around a topic that we draw out 
                of a hat. The stories we tell or topics we talk about range from true crime to creepy pastas, paranormal, 
                to horrifying history. Itâ€™s different every week, but  always chilling. Become a neighbor and join us for 
                some truly scary stories.</p>
